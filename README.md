KitchGym is a web-based application used for personal fitness and nutrition.

The website allows users to create an account to sign-in and save their KitchGym information such as workouts and foods.

A simple user interface allows the user to move seamlessly between inputting food and finding and documenting workouts.

KITCH

The website has a place for users to input the food/calories they are consuming to promote more mindful eating habits.

We believe that healthy choices start with mindful behavior, and the bests way to analyze one's own eating habits is to track them over time.  Knowledge is power, and KitchGym gives the user the power to know when they are succeeding nutritionally and when they are falling off.

GYM

On the gym side, users can select the muscle groups they would like to target in their workout and receive a personalized set of exercises for their workout. 

Exercise can be intimidating, but KitchGym makes it easy to get what you need from your regiments.
