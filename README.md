KitchGym is a web-based application used for personal fitness and nutrition.

The website has a place for users to input the food/calories they are consuming to promote more mindful eating habits.

On the gym side, users can select the muscle groups they would like to target in their workout and receive a personalized set of exercises for their workout. 

The website allows users to create an account to sign-in and save their KitchGym information such as workouts and foods.

A simple user interface allows the user to move seamlessly between inputting food and finding and documenting workouts.
